## Installation
To use this project you will need to clone or download the index.js file and call it in your terminal using "node index.js". You need to make sure you have node.js installed. If you don't you can download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/ . You will then need to install the npm by using "npm init" in your terminal. Then install the Inquirernpm by entering "npm install inquirer". 

## Usage
Once you have installed all the items and enter "node index.js" from the file root then you will be prompted with a series of questions. The information you enter will then be automatically added to your README file and your README will be created. You can always go into the file after and things your are missing if you don't have it all the first time around. This is to help guide you on the type of things you should have. In order to utilize the license function you will need to download the file in the license folder that correlates to your choosen license and fill out the information needed. That can then be added and stored in you projects directory. You can view a walkthrough video at the following link:
